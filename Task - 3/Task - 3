Task 3: Customer Segmentation / Clustering
Perform customer segmentation using clustering techniques. Use both profile information
(from Customers.csv) and transaction information (from Transactions.csv).
● You have the flexibility to choose any clustering algorithm and any number of clusters in
between(2 and 10)
● Calculate clustering metrics, including the DB Index(Evaluation will be done on this).
● Visualise your clusters using relevant plots.
Deliverables:
● A report on your clustering results, including:
○ The number of clusters formed.
○ DB Index value.
○ Other relevant clustering metrics.
● A Jupyter Notebook/Python script containing your clustering code.
Evaluation Criteria:
● Clustering logic and metrics.
● Visual representation of clusters.
